This project is a basic implementation of a Web Server in C++ using low-level socket programming. The main objective
of this project was to gain hands-on experience with networking concepts, system calls, and the HTTP protocol. It was
also an opportunity to strengthen understanding of file descriptors, IP addressing, and server-client communication.
The project was developed using the Xcode IDE.
